# Grow your stake

Kusama uses NPoS (Nominated Proof-of-Stake), comprising the roles of validators and nominators to maximize chain security. Validators take the role of both validating blocks and guaranteeing the finality of the chain, while nominators can help choose the set of validators by indicating their support weighted by KSMA. 

Both validators and nominators will earn rewards— and may be penalized—proportional to the amount that they stake, with validators having the ability to set some payment preferences.

## Stake and validate
Requirements: an account, KSMA, and a well-connected, fast computer

Create a “stash” account; this account should ideally be set up offline for maximum security.

## Staking and nominating FAQs
### What is staking?
Staking allows KSMA holders to participate in the security and availability of Kusama by leveraging their tokens to validate. Validators who stake KSMA, have an operational validator node, and behave honestly will get rewarded with KSMA. Actors who misbehave or who are unavailable/offline will have a portion of their stake slashed as a penalty.

### What are the annual returns for staking?
The exact number will vary depending on the amount of KSMA staked. If there is about 50% of KSMA staked, then each validator slot will receive about 20% annual returns for good behavior.

### What do I need to stake?
To become a validator, you need a computer with recently up-to-date specifications, a stable and fast internet connection, and KSMA to stake. If you do not have KSMA to stake, it is also possible to convince nominators to nominate you. Once you have acquired enough stake to make it into the validator set, you will start validating.

### What is nominating?
A nominator publishes a list of validator candidates that they trust, and puts down an amount of KSMA at stake to support them with. If some of these candidates are elected as validators, they share with them the payments, or the sanctions, on a per-staked-KSMA basis. Unlike validators, an unlimited number of parties can participate as nominators. As long as a nominator is diligent in their choice and only supports validator candidates with good security practices, their role carries low risk and provides a continuous source of revenue.

### What is the maximum annual interest possible when nominating?
The returns for nominating will vary due to several factors including, how many KSMA are staked for a given validator, how much your proportion is in that stake, and how many validators are in the set at a given time. NPoS uses @TODO

### What do I need to nominate?
All you need are some KSMA and decide which validator to nominate.
