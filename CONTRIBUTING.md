# Contributing

## This [wiki](https://github.com/w3f/Polkadot-wiki) is an **OPEN-ish Open Source Project**

This is an informational resource on Polkadot and the Polkadot ecosystem.

Pull requests, issues, or other contributions from the community are encouraged!  However, the final decision to add content will be made by the Web3 Foundation.

_Note: You will need a GitHub account to suggest changes or file issues. If you do not have a GitHub account, you may [sign up for one for free](https://github.com/join)._

## To Suggest Changes To A Page

If you have suggestions solely for one specific page, we recommend you file a pull request.

1. Click on the "Pencil" icon on the page you wish to edit.
2. If you are not logged in to GitHub, you will be asked to log in.  Enter your username and password and provide any additional necessary authentication.
3. You may edit the file using standard [GitHub-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for formatting.  It is recommended that you click "Preview Changes" before submitting the issue to ensure that you did not unintentionally break the formatting of the page.
4. When you are satisfied with the changes you have made, scroll to the bottom of the page.  There should be two textboxes under the label "Commit changes".
5. In the upper textbox, provide a succinct summary of the change made.
6. If necessary, add a longer, more detailed description in the second box.  This is not necessary for extremely small changes (e.g., `Fix typo 'teh' -> 'the'`), but in general, it is better to give more information than less.  Explain what the issue was and how your change improves the page.
7. Select the radio button for "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".  This will generate a default branch name for you, such as `laboon-patch-1`.  You can simply keep the default branch name.
8. Click the green "Propose file change" button.
9. A new page will load with your description showing.  Click on the green "Create pull request" button.
10. That's it!  Your pull request will now be available for review by the W3F team.

## To Suggest Larger Changes

While fixing a typo or updating some wording on a page may lend itself to a pull request, there may be broad issues in wording across the wiki, a request for additional content, or simply a question that you don't know the answer to but think should be included.  In such cases, filing an issue may be the better option.  Filing an issue allows you to state that there is a problem without also providing a fix to it.

1. In the upper-right hand corner of any page on the wiki, select the GitHub link (it should look like `w3f/polkadot-wiki`).
2. Near the top of the page, click on the Issues tab.
3. Click on the green "New issue" button.
4. For the title, write a brief summary of the issue (e.g., `Add description of Foo` or `Bar is now called Baz`).
5. In the "Leave a comment" textbox, explain what the problem or enhancement is, what you would like to see done to resolve it, and why it is important.
6. Click the green "Submit new issue" button.
7. That's it!  Your issue will now be available for review by the W3F team.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. Pull requests are preferred to issues, especially for small changes such as typos.  Issues should be used for generic or broad-based changes or missing content.
3. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
4. **Significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **pull request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
5. Pull requests to solicit feedback are _encouraged_ for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
6. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing Markdown style, language, and layout.
7. Correct grammar should be used at all times.  Pull requests with typos will not be merged until fixed.
8. Care should be taken to remain as objective and informative as possible.  There should be no editorializing, and external bias should not be present.
