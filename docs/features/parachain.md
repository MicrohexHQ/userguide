# Secure a Parachain slot

Kusama will have support for parachains. Cumulus, the set of tools for writing parachains that are based on Substrate, will land in the coming months. While deploying Substrate-based parachains won't be possible before then, we plan to begin parachain auctions for Kusama soon before so that as soon as Cumulus is deployed you can launch your parachain!
